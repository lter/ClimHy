Re: Data, Plots, and Downloads

On http://wwwdata.forestry.oregonstate.edu/climhy/plot.pl
would recommend including state location in the site pick-list for those who are not
intimately familiar with all the sites.

on http://wwwdata.forestry.oregonstate.edu/climhy/temp/plot_image.htm
you might want to check your English:

In HTML, tab-delimited, etc., output I don't know what the "Flag" entry means.

Re: Data, Plots, and Downloads

There appears to be an error in the way that climDB is pulling data. I have been using the options to pull total_precip and mean_temp data by month for most of the LTER sites. I noticed that if you pull the daily data for lets say Andrews Forest and then pull the same data monthly and compare the two it is obvious that it isn't correctly totaling the data by month. The web based plots look like they are probably ok(haven't fully verified) but the csv download is reporting incorrect data based on the daily data from the csv download.  I think this is a problem for all of the monthly/yearly downloads.

Please let me know what the situation is.

Thank You,

Michael Wernke

Today I tried to pull down the Metadata Report for the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest and kept getting a blank screen (3 May 2005).  Rob Ahl had sent in the information and the file had been previously available.  Is there a problem with the data?
Thanks.

Re: Data, Plots, and Downloads

When doing the yearly summary plot for El Verde the X-axis starts in 2001, instead of 1975 and repeats years.

Am I doing something wrong?

Re: Data, Plots, and Downloads

Very nice summary of data--good to see the rich source of data from LTER and USDA USFS sites.

A couple of comments:
It would be useful to the community to have this summary registered in the LTER EML catalog.

Would it be possible to provide data aggregated for months / years, in addition to days?  For example, the Marcell data is available at several aggregation / compositing periods, but Hubbard Brook is not.

Re: Data, Plots, and Downloads

Hello,

My question is in regards to whether the annual precipitation values are summations of January - December or October - September.  They appear to be the former.  Did I miss the module that allows a user to define which annual period is used in the calculation?  If there isn't such a module, maybe it would be better to hard-code in a water year total.

Thanks,

Adam K.

Do you have any hourly climate data for access? I need it to test a temperature model which simulate daily dynamics of soil temperature.

Re: Report of CLIMDB/HYDRODB Metadata
Hi,
I found a tabular listing of met station names, but what I really need is a table with lat/long/elevation of all stations.
Is there a way to obtain this info without having to download the PDFs of each station?
Thanks,

Re: Data, Plots, and Downloads

Hi,
I ran a query on air (TMEA) and soil (SMEA) temperature data from the McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER for stations Lake Bonney, Lake Hoare, and Lake Fryxell.  The data look great, but there isn't any information on how soil temperature was calculated. On the MCM LTER website, there are three values: 0 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm depths. However, your site only gives one variable, so is it the average of all three? The middle value?
Can you tell me who might have this information, or where I might find it online?
Thanks,
Breana

Re: Data, Plots, and Downloads
I wanted to retrieve climate data for the Florida Coastal LTER. I gave my personal information on page 1. On page 2, the header said to choose a station and a choose a variable, but no choices were offered - therefore, on going to page 3 I received an error message.
