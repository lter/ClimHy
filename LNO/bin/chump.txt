ClimDB HydroDB Utility Managment Program
CHUMP
Version 1.2

Kyle Kotwica 10/2002

This is a utility for managing the CLIMHY database, the FUNDME module, and the plotting routine. 

File system:
	chump.pl - the Perl/TK program that deals with the interface.
	display.pm - the Perl module that manages the CLIMHY database.
	conf.pm - the Perl module that manages the climdb.conf file.
	climdb.conf - the configuration file needed for FUNDME et al.
		This should be with FUNDME (in the cgi directory)
	danteBW.gif - a picture of a dog.
	clim-lib.pm - a libarary of functions used by the all of the above.
	CHUMP.txt - this file.
climdb.conf and clim_lib.pm need to be shared with all of the other files involved with the FUNDME project. 
There is a BEGIN block in chump.pl that should be edited with the path way where these two files are located. 
All other files should be in ths same directory as chump.pl. See climdb.txt for more details.

Notes:

	There is very little data checking. If someone wants to put in a latitude of a$3e.ood or some such thing, 
	who am I to complain. This could be added but the user would normally be entering into the database directly. 
	It is assumed if they got this far they wont muck things up too much more with this utility.
